# AlphaBot

Just messing around with discord.py API

## Functionalities
Current *useful* commands:
* ,random: generates random numbers
* ,say: repeats things ... thats it
* ,add: math engine ... for adding only
* ,membercount: returns server name and number of members
* ,boop: boops people
* ,annoy: annoys people, a spam bot
* ,face [number] sends a number of random face emojis

## Crash Cource
How to use the discord.py API explained (quickly)

To add a command, do
```
@bot.command(ctx, arguments)
async def command_name():
    do stuff
```

To send strings to the server, use
```
await ctx.send("string")
```
