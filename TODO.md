# Things that need to be done

## Priority
* complete biblebooks.json

## Others
* fix the random cat photo generator through a better html parser (later)
* automatic server member count updater
* administrative commands:
```
ban (reason), mute (time), remove role, add role
```
* change images to pull from Google Images instead of Wikipedia
* figure out everything to do with reactions and bots
* **cloud hosting**
* add a random aspect to error messages for more fun (done through error.json maybe)
 
## Finished
* make a better *help* command
